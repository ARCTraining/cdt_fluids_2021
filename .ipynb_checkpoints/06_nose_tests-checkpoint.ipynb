    "## Testing Frameworks\n",
    "Each time we make changes to a code, we would like to test it. This can be tedious and that might prevent us from testing. We want to make testing as easy as version control is. A testing framework can help us.\n",
    "\n",
    "The testing framework we will discuss today is a python library called nose. However, there are several other testing frameworks available in most languages. Most notably there is JUnit in Java which can arguably be attributed to inventing the testing framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Nose\n",
    "In nose, each test is a function whose name begins with the letters test_. We can group tests together in files whose names also begin with the letters test_. To execute our tests we run the command nosetests. This automatically searches the current directory and its subdirectories for test files, and runs the tests they contain.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Applying nose to the range_overlap example\n",
    "To see how this works, let's look at how we'd use it to test the range_overlap example.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to put our range_overlap in a file `ranges.py`:"

    "nose searches for files starting with test_ and runs functions called test_. Nose writes a . for every successful test. Failed tests get a F. At the end we get a summary of any failed tests.
